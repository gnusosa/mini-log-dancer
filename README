mini-log-dancer

A minimalistic blog engine built on Perl Dancer.

See http://www.perldancer.org/ for details on Dancer.

See http://advent.perldancer.org/ for details on how I built 
the blog engine on Perl Dancer.

See http://log.gnusosa.net/ for a working demo.
My personal weblog. :D 


FEATURES

It features an archive handler and a feed handler. 
It lacks a comments section and categories.

There is a category logic built into it, but it requires
some customization. You can find it in code.pm, and calls db.pm

DEPENDENCIES

The blog engine uses the following Perl modules: 

	* Dancer::Plugin::Feed
	* Dancer::Plugin::Database
	* Dancer::Template::Haml
	* DateTime::Format::Strptime
	* Time::Piece
